        When I was 15 I started volunteering for the events team of ManaCube. Two teammates and I were appointed as
        Event Coordinators and, since the team had just been restructured, we were given fairly free rein to help
        wherever we felt comfortable. I spent most of my free time working to improve the in-game experience and, after
        8 months, I was promoted to the brand-new position of Event Manager.

        <br><br><br>

        I spent just over 2 years as the server's Event Manager. During my time in the role, I:
        <ul>
          <li>learnt to program Minecraft plugins in Java using the PaperMC API;</li>
          <li>lead event development projects;</li>
          <li>designed and held training sessions for new team members;</li>
          <li>fixed issues that arose during live events, both technical bugs and players' problems;</li>
          <li>and ensured that our two weekly events ran smoothly every time.</li>
        </ul>

        A friend of mine that I'd met on ManaCube, Kath, decided to start her own server. In 2021, I offered to help
        with some bug fixing and she decided to offer me a job as a developer on her team. I quickly accepted and ended
        up spending my first year at uni working on GroundedMC in my free time.

        <h1><img class="Icon" src="images/PaperMC.png" alt="PaperMC Icon"> <u>Independent Plugin Development</u></h1>

        When not working for a server, I spent time developing my own plugins that I'd publish online. Usually I'd come
        across some feature of the PaperMC API that I wanted to learn to use, design a plugin that made use of it and
        develop it on a locally hosted server. Unfortunately, a lot of the projects ended unfinished, as I was only
        really interested in learning about the features rather than actually making and maintaining publishable
        projects.
